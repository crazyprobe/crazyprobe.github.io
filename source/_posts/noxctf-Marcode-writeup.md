### 思路

链接地址下载后为一个视频，视频每一帧都是一个二维码，需要逐帧分析视频图片并对结果进行二次操作

<!--more-->

### 步骤

1. 视频逐帧保存为图片(*2种方法*)

   - FFmpeg
     `$ffmpeg -i ffmpeg_test.avi frames_%03d.jpg -hide_banner`

   - cv2

     ```python
     import cv2
     video_full_path="video/01_01.wmv"
     cap  = cv2.VideoCapture(video_full_path)
     print cap.isOpened()
     frame_count = 1
     success = True
     while(success):
         success, frame = cap.read()
         print 'Read a new frame: ', success
      
         params = []
         #params.append(cv.CV_IMWRITE_PXM_BINARY)
         params.append(1)
         cv2.imwrite("video" + "_%d.jpg" % frame_count, frame, params)
      
         frame_count = frame_count + 1
      
     cap.release()
     ```

2. 解析图片为url

   - python zbar模块
   - [批量二维码解析](http://pc.wwei.cn/) windows、mac版，导出到Excel

3. url转为对应字符

   打开url获取对应字符并批量替换

4. 字符组成文字片段

   如使用Excel根据序号进行排序，获取排序后的字符

5. 检查片段内容寻找flag
